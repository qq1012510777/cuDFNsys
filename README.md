# cuDFNsys

_cuDFNsys_ is an open-source CUDA library (under the GPL license) for DFN generations. It is also able to simulate flow (steady-state) and particle transport in DFNs, based on the mixed hybrid finite element method and particle tracking algorithm.

_cuDFNsys_ does not support the GUI and can only run on Ubuntu. _cuDFNsys_ is not friendly to users unfamiliar with Linux, C++ and CMake.

The directory _GenMultipleFamilies_ shows how to generate multiple families of fractures.

# Prerequisites
_cuDFNsys_ should be installed and run on Ubuntu.

_cuDFNsys_ relies on several open packages: OpenMP, CUDA, Eigen, Gmsh, UMFPACK and HDF5.

The Gmsh C++ API that _cuDFNsys_ relies on should support the OCC mode, meaning that the occt library is required.

* [Installation of CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

* [Installation of Gmsh and occt](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/wikis/Gmsh-compilation)

* [Installation of Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download)

* [Installation of UMFPACK](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse)

Installations of OpenMP, Eigen and HDF5 are not difficult. Just google.

# Environment setup
After installations of above-mentioned packages, _cuDFNsys_ should be linked to them. In the directory 'Modules', .cmake files can be found, where the path of corresponding packages should be added/set/changed.

For example, in the 'Modules/FindGMSH.cmake', you'll see

    SET(GMSH_INCLUDE_SEARCH_PATH
        $ENV{HOME}/pkg/gmsh-4.8.4-source/MY_GMSH/include
    )
    
    SET(GMSH_LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATH
        $ENV{HOME}/pkg/gmsh-4.8.4-source/MY_GMSH/lib
    )

The two user-set variables are paths of the Gmsh header file and library, respectively. You have to change them because you are bound to have different paths for them.

In the 'QuickStartGuide/CMakeLists.txt', you'll see

    set (CUDFNSYS_ROOT $ENV{HOME}/cuDFNsys)

The above variable is the path of _cuDFNsys_. You, again, might change it.

# Visualization

After simulation, _cuDFNsys_ outputs .h5 and .m (and/or .py) files, and you can visualize them by the generated .m or .py file. 

The visulization with MATLAB is simple, you just need the license of MATLAB. 

With Python, you need to install the _mayavi_ Python package. _mayavi_ is a very good visualization engine. The Matplotlib package is not good at 3D visualizations, see [Why my 3D plot doesnâ€™t look right at certain viewing angles](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.2/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/faq.html).

# Manual
Right now, I provide a quickstart guide to explain how can one do simulations with _cuDFNsys_ functions. See QuickStartGuide/src/main.cu.

To compile and run QuickStartGuide example, run compileCode.sh in the directory-'QuickStartGuide'.

For example, run the command with your shell: **bash compileCode.sh 1000 500 1e5 0 0**

Explanation of the four arguments:

* Number of particles: 1000

* Number of time steps: 500

* Delta t: 1e5

* Diffusion (local): 0

* Do not remove dead-ends: 0

# Directories

_QuickStartGuide_: a quickstart guide CUDA example to show how to do simulations with _cuDFNsys_ functions.

_CodingGuideline_: my coding guidline, e.g. how to name a member variable in a class

_Modules_: cmake script to find packages that _cuDFNsys_ relies on in a Ubuntu system

_include_: header files containing declarations of functions/classes

_src_: source files containing definitions of functions/classes

_PercolationTest_, _TestFunctionsOnlyForDevlopment_, _TestResolutionEffect_ and other directories are all about examples (user's interfaces), with different purposes, meanwhile showing that how to call _cuDFNsys_ functions, with cmake and other tools.
