# cuDFNsys

The _cuDFNsys_ is an open-source CUDA library (under the GPL license) for DFN generations. It is also able to simulate the static flow and particle transport in DFNs, based on the mixed hybrid finite element method and particle tracking algorithm.

The _cuDFNsys_ does not support GUI and can only run on the Ubuntu. The _cuDFNsys_ is not friendly to users who do not familiar with the Linux, C++ and CMake.

The _cuDFNsys_ right now can only generate one group of fractures, because I am studying percolation in DFNs and some quantities in percolation theory are easier to calculate with only one fracture group. Geometrical attributes of fractures follow certain distributions. In reality, multiple fracture famlies might be observed.

# Prerequisites
The _cuDFNsys_ should be installed and run on the Ubuntu.

The _cuDFNsys_ relies on several open packages: OpenMP, CUDA, Eigen, Gmsh, UMFPACK and HDF5.

Installations of these libraries could be disturbing, even you are familiar with Linux, CMake, C++ and so on. I cannot write a bash file that help you install all these libraries at one time. You should go to their homepages, and install them one by one. The Gmsh C++ API that the _cuDFNsys_ relies on should support OCC mode, meaning that the occt library is required. _I am very willing to help, but you should be familiar with the Linux, CMake, C++ and so on_.

* [Installation of CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

* [Installation of Gmsh and occt](https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/-/wikis/Gmsh-compilation)

* [Installation of Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download)

* [Installation of UMFPACK](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse)

Installation of OpenMP, Eigen and HDF5 are easy, and you can just do it with google.

# Environment setup
After installations of above-mentioned packages, the _cuDFNsys_ should be linked to them. In the directory 'Modules', .cmake files can be found, where the path of corresponding packages should be added/set/changed.

For example, in the 'Modules/FindGMSH.cmake', you'll see

    SET(GMSH_INCLUDE_SEARCH_PATH
        $ENV{HOME}/pkg/gmsh-4.8.4-source/MY_GMSH/include
    )
    
    SET(GMSH_LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATH
        $ENV{HOME}/pkg/gmsh-4.8.4-source/MY_GMSH/lib
    )

The two user-set variables are paths of the Gmsh header file and library, respectively. You have to change them because you are bound to have different paths for them.

In the 'QuickStartGuide/CMakeLists.txt', you'll see

    set (CUDFNSYS_ROOT $ENV{HOME}/cuDFNsys)

The above variable is the path of the _cuDFNsys_. You, again, might change it.

# Visualization

After simulation, the _cuDFNsys_ outputs .h5 and .m (and/or .py) files, and you can visualize them by the generated .m or .py file. 

The visulization with MATLAB is simple, you just need the license of MATLAB. 

With Python, you need to install the mayavi Python package. Sorry again for the inconvenience, the installation of the mayavi could be difficult, but the mayavi is a very good visualization engine. The Matplotlib package is not good at 3D visualizations, see [Why my 3D plot doesnâ€™t look right at certain viewing angles](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.2/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/faq.html).

# Manual
Right now, I provide a quickstart guide to explain how can one do simulations with _cuDFNsys_ functions. See QuickStartGuide/src/main.cu.

To compile and run QuickStartGuide example, run compileCode.sh in the directory-'QuickStartGuide'.

For example, run the command with your shell: **bash compileCode.sh 1000 500 1e5 0 0**

Explanation of the four arguments:

* Number of particles: 1000

* Number of time steps: 500

* Delta t: 1e5

* Diffusion (local): 0

* Do not remove dead-ends: 0

# Directories

_QuickStartGuide_: a quickstart guide CUDA example to show how to do simulations with _cuDFNsys_ functions.

_CodingGuideline_: my coding guidline, e.g. how to name a member variable in a class

_Modules_: cmake script to find packages that the _cuDFNsys_ relies on in a Ubuntu system

_include_: header files containing declarations of functions/classes

_src_: source files containing definitions of functions/classes

_PercolationTest_, _TestFunctionsOnlyForDevlopment_, _TestResolutionEffect_ and other directories are all about examples (user's interfaces), with different purposes, meanwhile showing that how to call _cuDFNsys_ functions, with the cmake and other tools.
